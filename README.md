# About

Every year on 1st March people in Bulgaria celebrate a centuries-old tradition called the day of Baba Marta ("Baba" means Grandma and "Mart" means March), related to sending off the winter and welcoming the approaching spring. On that day and a few days afterwards, people exchange and wear the so-called “Martenitsa”. The martenitsa consists of decorative pieces of red and white twisted threads, symbolising health and happiness. The martenitsas are given away to family and friends and are worn around the wrist or on clothes. The martenitsa is made of twined red and white threads – woolen, silk, or cotton. The most typical martenitsa represents two small dolls, known as Pizho and Penda. Pizho is the male doll, usually in white colour. Penda is the female doll, usually in red colour. Martenitsas come in a variety of shapes and sizes: bracelets, necklaces, tassels, pompoms and balls. The white is a symbol of purity, innocence, beauty and joy. The red is associated with health, vitality, fertility and bravery. According to the tradition, people wear martenitsas for a certain period, the end of which is usually associated with the first signs of spring – seeing a stork or a fruit tree in blossom.

The "Baba Marta" protocol allows you to buy `MartenitsaToken` and to give it away to friends. Also, if you want, you can be a producer. The producer creates `MartenitsaTokens` and sells them. There is also a voting for the best `MartenitsaToken`. Only producers can participate with their own `MartenitsaTokens`. The other users can only vote. The winner wins 1 `HealthToken`. If you are not a producer and you want a `HealthToken`, you can receive one if you have 3 different `MartenitsaTokens`. More `MartenitsaTokens` more `HealthTokens`. The `HealthToken` is a ticket to a special event (producers are not able to participate). During this event each participant has producer role and can create and sell own `MartenitsaTokens`.

## MartenitsaMarketplace.sol
